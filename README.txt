Question: Can players effectively use their sense of hearing to locate objects? And are there technological limitations to using sound in this way?

Hypothesis: Players will be able to correctly identify where non-moving objects are around them from sound alone especially in the right and left directions. 
	There will be difficulties when it comes to vertical sound as the way headphones recreate sound will limit their abilities.

Controls:
- Mouse:
	- Left Click = eliminate objects
	- Move Left/Right/Up/Down = look left/right/up/down
- Keyboard:
	- I = decrease spawn limit
	- O = increase spawn limit
	- K = decrease check interval
	- L = increase check interval
	- P = start challenge
	- Esc = quit prototype
	- Windows + Shift + R = reload prototype

Additional Information:
- To eliminate objects you simply need to look at the object and left click
- The max spawn limit is the maximum number of objects that can be in the scene at any given time
- The check interval is how often the scene is checked to see if more objects need to be spawned
- The challenge lasts 50 seconds and every 10 seconds the max spawn limit increases
- During the challenge eliminating objects adds 1 to the score
